To mark the law's anniversary, the EFF, ACLU, Demand Progress, Free Press and dozens of other public advocacy groups in the StopWatching.us coalition are planning a rally to protest mass surveillance in Washington, DC. We've spent countless hours organizing buses to transport people from nearby cities, assembled a great lineup of speakers, and filed the relevant permits.

**If you own a website, no matter how big or small, we need your help.**

Mass surveillance is a grave challenge to privacy on the Internet, and threatens our ability to communicate and conduct transactions privately online. This is a critical moment: If we don't convince Congress to make meaningful change now, while Snowden's leaks have the public's attention, we may never have another chance.
